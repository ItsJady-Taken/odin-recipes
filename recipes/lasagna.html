    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Meat:</strong>

        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Onion and Garlic:</strong>
            An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Tomato products:</strong>
            You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Sugar:</strong>
            Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong>
            his lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Lasagna noodle:</strong>
            Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        </p></li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong>
            Gather all your ingredients.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p></li>

        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 8:</strong>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Step 9:</strong>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
